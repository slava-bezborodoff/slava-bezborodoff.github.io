  <h1>Hi</h1>

  <p>My name is Vyacheslav Bezborodov. I’m a lifelong resident of Russia – born and bred here. My current city is Moscow.</p>

  <p>Writing codes has always been a long-term interest of mine. Good music’s formed a habitual addiction to study English. Good people is what I’m inspired of and try to meet to. From time to time I jog in the parks or do cycling.</p>

  <p>I have a master`s degree in Math & Informatics which I got in 2017. But it doesn’t mean that I stopped. Reading books, watching videos and listening to podcasts – that’s keep me going.</p>

  <p>I am a web developer. Funny school Pascal programs were superseded by severe C++. Then pythonic way of doing things came in the town. Now is a time for my first foray into React and TypeScript. Kinda turn into fullstack.</p>

  <p>I become more and more interested in working on projects rather than tasks. Leading projects through the workflow is quite a complicated thing. But my belief is that a fullstack wiz can sort that out in a proper way.</p>

  <p>Have a question? Feel free to contact me.</p>
