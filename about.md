## Hi, I'm Slava Bezborodov

Iâ€™m a web developer. I have a master`s degree in Math & Informatics.

I understand:
- how to build a web system,
- why feedback is so important.

I can:
- plan my time,
- get things done.

Have a question? Feel free to contact me.

Check out [my wiki](https://slavabezborodov56.gitbook.io/wiki/) where I share everything I know.
